I began by testing the muscle/seqaln function in bio3d on some aligned hemaglobin beta sequences.

First read in the fasta file obtained from SeaView

```{r}
aln.test <- read.fasta("~/Desktop/test_muscle_aln.fst")

```

Trim the file down to the input sequence

```{r}
aln.test$ali <-  aln.test$ali[ , 107:990]

```

Use the seqaln() function on the trimmed fasta file
```{r}
aln.test.trim <- seqaln(aln.test)
View(aln.test.trim)
```
